[1] Get an interactive node:

srun --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -p compute --reservation=UCSB2018Res -t 02:00:00 --wait 0 /bin/bash

[2] Load the singularity module and get an interactive shell

module load singularity
singularity shell /share/apps/gpu/singularity/sdsc_ubuntu_tf1.1_keras_R.img 

[3] Clone your repos

git clone https://github.com/sinkovit/PythonSeries
git clone https://github.com/sinkovit/RSeries

(Do this in the singularity environment since our default git will throw a TSLV1 error)

[4] Launch the notebook

ipython notebook --no-browser --ip="*" &

This will give you an address which has localhost in it and a token. Something like:

http://localhost:8888/?token=389587c9d1b69f8f595e7d8bfdd83c9961ed26b8b3f1bb3e

You can replace localhost with comet-02-17.sdsc.edu (or what ever host you get) and then paste it into your browser. That should get you into the running notebook. From there everything should be working as a regular notebook. Note: This token is your auth so don't email/send it around (I already stopped the above link).

[5] Once you are done with your work:

fg
and then kill the task and shutdown the notebook server.

[6] exit twice (once for singularity, once for ending job) to logout of compute node.
